/**
 * Vitest global setup — runs ONCE per `vitest run` invocation, across all
 * forks. Spins up a single-node **replica set** via `MongoMemoryReplSet`
 * (not a plain standalone) so the entire test suite — including the
 * transaction safety tests and the outbox atomicity assertions — can
 * exercise real `session.withTransaction` semantics.
 *
 * Why a replica set instead of a standalone mongod:
 *   - Standalone mongod returns error 263 on `startTransaction`, forcing
 *     every transaction test into its `allowFallback` branch. That means
 *     we never actually observe a real commit or a real rollback in CI.
 *   - The outbox pattern's entire guarantee ("outbox row commits atomically
 *     with the business write, or not at all") is undetectable without
 *     a real transaction. Skipping that coverage defeats the point of
 *     shipping the recipe.
 *   - Single-node replica sets boot in ~2-3s on modern hardware — small
 *     price for covering the one behavior that distinguishes transactional
 *     writes from unreliable ones.
 *
 * To run against an external MongoDB (real replica set, CI smoke, sharded
 * cluster), set `MONGODB_URI` before invoking vitest:
 *     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/?replicaSet=rs0 vitest run
 * When `MONGODB_URI` is already present, globalSetup skips its own server
 * entirely — the caller owns the lifecycle.
